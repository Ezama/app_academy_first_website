            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Manchester United Football Club, founded in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR, is one of the most successful and
                iconic football clubs in the world. The club changed its name to Manchester United in 1902 and moved to
                Old Trafford in 1910. United enjoyed early successes, but its true global rise began under Sir Matt
                Busby, who rebuilt the team after the 1958 Munich air disaster and led them to European Cup glory in
                1968. Sir Alex Ferguson’s era from 1986 to 2013 cemented United’s dominance, with 13 Premier League
                titles and two Champions League trophies, shaping its legendary status.</p>
